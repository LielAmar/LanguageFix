## Information
LanguageFix is a Spigot/Paper plugin, with BungeeCord support.
<br>It is an advanced version of my plugins [HebrewFix](https://bitbucket.org/hebrewfix/hebrewfix-plugin/src/develop/) and [HebrewFixBungeecord](https://github.com/LielAmar/HebrewFixBungeecord/tree/master).

This plugin adds support to foreign languages such as Hebrew and Arabic, which are going from Right to Left,
<br>unlike most languages, that go left to right.

LanguageFix uses a better algorithm and supports BungeeCord, all within the same plugin.
<br>to use LanguageFix for BungeeCord, you need to put the jar file in /plugins/ for your BungeeCord server, and delete it from every Spigot/Paper server.

## Features
* Permission-Based
* Configurable
* Strong & Fast algorithms
* Multiple RTL Language Support
& Bungeecord Support

## Using Liel's LanguageFix
You can download LanguageFix from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/language-fix.85682/).
<br>After downloading, simply drug it into your plugins folder and reload the server!
<br>* If you use BungeeCord, install the plugin in your BungeeCord/plugins/ folder instead!
